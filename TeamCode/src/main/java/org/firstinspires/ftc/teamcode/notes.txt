collection of notes, mainly from writing theoretical code
(not chronologically ordered)

Robot.java (on theoreticalFullExtension calculation)
//approximately 3 rotations - "2cm"
//2cm ~ 0.787402 inches, 0.00929886553 / 0.787402 inches = ticks for 2cm (0.011809552856614936), 3*537.7 ~ 1613.1
// 1613.1 - 0.00732194531 ~ ticks for full extension if not we're f'd
// theoretically, we get an approximate number of ticks for the full thing
// official information says 3.1 rotations apparently
//https://www.gobilda.com/low-side-cascading-kit-two-stage-376mm-travel/
//top of the alliance shipping hub is 14.7, assuming the above is the correct slides, it reaches 14.8
//so alternate fullExtension to use is LinearSlideTicks(14.7);
(on LinearSlides diameter and circumference)
// original measurement was 5in
//alt circumference ~ 4.75in.
(on motorArcLength, the Holy Grail of theoretical code)
/* old notes
all the turning math is done on the assumption that driving a distance as a line
is the same as driving that distance around a circumference
as in, the turning motion does not counteract movement along the circumference
and if all 4 wheels drive for 10 inches, then if half the wheels drive opposite to start turning,
they would still drive 10 inches, just along the circumference of their rotation
this is likely not true, but I cannot find math online and can't really model it either
to correct much, just do testing

Future.java (on theoreticalMiddleExtension)
/*alliance shipping hub middle level top edge is 8.5 inches up,
assuming that the extension servo will cover the remaining height to dump freight in*/

TeleOP.java (henry L)
//        // DO NOT D ELETE idk why tf it flips it wasnt like this last time someone did
//        // something, but im too lazy to go through each method rn
//        // oh shit it might fuck up during auto
//        // if it does then we have to change everything
//        // can you reverse motor directions????????????
//        // if you can that would save a lot of time
//        // not tryna go through each method and change it one by one
//        // thats disgusting
